This assignment used Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, and Javascript to create a site that allows users to add train information to a display board, similar to the displays at the airport that list flight arrival / departure information.  The user input the Train Name, Train Destination, the time that the first train ran, and the arrival frequency.  This information was then sent to the display, along with the arrival time of the next incoming train, and the number of minutes from the current time until its arrival.  The time formatting was done using Moment.js.
